# Contributing

Hi there! Interested in contributing to /r/anime's theme? We appreciate the help, but there are a few things to keep in mind:

## Issues

- Include screenshots if you're reporting a visual bug or other discrepancy.
- List any extensions you're using to make our lives easier when debugging.
- Please don't be a dick.

## Pull requests

- Always submit pull requests against the `dev` branch. PRs against `master` will be met with a close and a moderately condescending comment.
- When submitting pull requests for new features, they'll have to be discussed by the mod team and likely voted on internally before we merge or close. These types of contributins will probably take a while.
- When a PR is merged, it'll be loaded up into /r/animestaging, a private test sub. From here it'll be confirmed to work and stuff before it's then merged into the live theme.
- Memes in commit messages are encouraged.
